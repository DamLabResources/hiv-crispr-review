def gRNA_score_hit(guide_seq, hit_seq, dampening=False):
    """Score gRNA hit

    This scores the gRNA hit based on the method described by Hsu et al
    as implemented in http://crispr.mit.edu/about.

    This takes into account that mutations at PAM-distal sites have
    minimal effects while those in the middle and PAM-proximal sites have
    more effect on binding. With the `dampening` flag sequences with more
    mismatches are more drastically penalized.

    As such, it is important to provide the gRNA and hit_seq in the proper
    orientation. If the gRNA is arranged like this:

    ATG ATG ATG ATC ATC ATC T NGG <- PAM

    Then it is in the correct orientation. If instead the gRNA is arranged
    like this:

    GGN ATG ATG ATG ATC ATC ATC T

    Then both the gRNA and hit_seq need to be reversed. Use the gRNA[::-1]
    idiom to do so easily.

    Parameters
    ----------

    guide_seq : str
        This should be the protospacer region of the gRNA. Do not include the
        PAM region. The PAM is assumed to immediately follow this region.

    hit_seq : str
        This is the potential binding site of the protospacer region of the
        gRNA. The PAM is assumed to immediately follow this region.

    dampening : bool, optional
        If True, this implements the extra penality for high-mismatch items.
        This is often done when search for genomic off-targets but not in
        the desired region.

    Returns
    -------

    score : float
        The likelihood of binding as estimated by the Hsu et al method.
